1.1 - Materials

      The first section of the file specifies a list of at least one material. A
      single material is declared with this syntax:

      |                                                                        |
      |  material MATERIAL_ID :                                                |
      |                                                                        |
      |      thermal conductivity       1.30e-04 ;                             |
      |      volumetric heat capacity   1.63e-12 ;                             |
      |                                                                        |
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------

      where :

      * spaces, new lines and tabulations are skipped ;
      * keywords are in low case ;
      * MATERIAL_ID is a unique identifier to refer to this material ;
      * thermal conductivity is expressed as     [ W / ( um  * K ) ] ;
      * volumetric heat capacity is expressed as [ J / ( um3 * K ) ] .
